greeting=<h1 class=\"major\" ><font color=\"#000000\">Hello, <br />my name is <br />Aliaksandr <br/>Kananovich</font></h1>
my.history=<h2 class="major">Profession and hobby.</h2><p> For a long time I worked in the field of maintenance and repair at the leading mining enterprise of the republic. Java programming was a hobby. However, after the events of the summer of 2020 and the repressions against me, I realized that I would have to change my profession. </p>

Under the mentor retraining program, I studied the following technologies under the guidance of a programmer with 12 years of experience: <b>Spring framework</b>, <b>Git</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JS</b>.</p>
examples=<h2 class="major">Work examples.</h2><p>One of the works in which I applied all the knowledge gained in the retraining process is the creation of the <a href="https://fitnesstoall.by"><b>Fitnesstoall.by</b></a> website. This site is written in Java and deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. The source code of the project can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/yarrou/siteToOK"><b>here</b></a>. </p>
